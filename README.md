### What is it?
__Canvas Strikethrough__ is a *Chrome Extension* that allows users to mark any event on the Canvas calendar as complete. This is useful for students who want to stay more organized and keep track of which assignments they have completed when their instructor does not require them to submit their work through Canvas.

### How does it work?
After installing the extension, either visit the Canvas calendar, or go to a assignment/page of your choice. You will then see a new option to mark that assignment as complete.

### Features
- Mark assignments/pages as complete from the calendar.
- Mark assignments/pages as complete from the assignment/page itself.
- View a list of all events manually marked as complete.

### Things to note
- Marking an assignment as complete is only for your own reference. It does not affect your submission/grade, nor does it notify your instructor.
- This extension only works on the computer you install it on. If you mark an assignment as complete on your laptop, it will not be marked as complete on your phone.
- Due to complexities of getting the extension approved on the Chrome Web Store, the extension is not allowed to run on all pages. Unfortunately each university has their own domain for Canvas, so I have to manually add each domain to the list of allowed domains. If your university is not on the list, please open an issue on GitHub and I will add it as soon as possible.

#### Allowed Canvas Domains
Instructions on how to add your own university's Canvas domain will be added in the future. For now, if you would like to add your own domain, please open an issue on GitHub.
